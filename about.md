This is the homepage for the EEB graduate student bioinformatics club/workshop run by Felix Beaudry and Tyler Kent.
We'll use this to post slides from meetings, provide links to relevant resources, and let you know what's happening at the next meeting.
This site should be updated at least bi-weekly to post slides and an announcement about the upcoming meeting, but there may be more frequent updates.

We're using [Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do) by [Vince Buffalo](http://vincebuffalo.org) as the basis of the meetings.
If there's time or interest, we'll provide time for troubleshooting individual problems.

If you're not on the email list, you can send Tyler an email at the link on the bottom of the page or Felix at felix.beaudry@mail.utoronto.ca.

Cheers,

Tyler and Felix
