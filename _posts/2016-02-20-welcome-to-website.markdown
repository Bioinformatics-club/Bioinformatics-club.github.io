I finally set up the website for our group!

I'll use this to post my slides from meetings, let you know about future meetings, and share relevant resources.
Hopefully this will be helpful as reference in case you forget anything or can't find your notes.

Resources are in the Resources/ tab, slides are in the Slides/ tab, etc.
