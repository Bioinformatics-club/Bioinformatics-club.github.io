Hey all,

we'll resume with our regular meeting time this Friday at 10am in the third floor round room.
I'm considering making this a weekly thing instead of bi-weekly, but will probably change the day and time to accomodate more people.
I'll send out a google poll for this later in the week, along with an announcement about this week's chapter and slides.
